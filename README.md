# University Registration System

## Project Overview
A Java console-based university registration system that supports multiple user roles: Admin, Advisor, and Student. The system handles course registration, curriculum tracking, and academic progress reporting.

## Tech Stack
- Java (Console Application)
- OOP principles: encapsulation, class design, role-based access
